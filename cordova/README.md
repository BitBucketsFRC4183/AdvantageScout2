## Cordova

This folder contains the code for the native Android app, built using [Apache Cordova](https://cordova.apache.org). The HTML and server interface are automatically copied from the root folder during the build.

Check the requirements for the Android build [here](https://cordova.apache.org/docs/en/11.x/guide/platforms/android/index.html#system-requirements). Once these requirements are met, the following commands will build the Android app:

```
npm install
npm run build
```
